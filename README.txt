INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO RUN GWIZ.

Go to folder “Data”
Here there are two example csv files with GWAS data.
Using the format of those files as a template, load your own data into a csv file in the folder “data”. Take special care to ensure the column names are written exactly as they are in the example csv files. 

Now load “GWAS_call_batch.R”
Go to line 3 and change the working directory to the appropriate location.
Select all and run the code.
A table called aucout should appear with your results.

After running the code two folders will also be created in your working directory. “Results_data” contains the coefficients of the logistic 
regression model created, ROC curve plots and the AUROC.
“Resampled_data” contains the simulated population created from your GWAS summary level data.

Congrats you are now an expert in using GWIZ!
